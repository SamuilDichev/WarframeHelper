# Warframe Helper
Helps find profitable trades for the game [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com)

**No longer maintained, unknown if it works**

## Terminology
- **Platinum** - premium currency purchaseble with **real world money** OR tradeable with players **in exchange for items**
- **Ducats** - in-game currency rewarded for selling items to in-game NPC, currency for high value items from the same NPC

## What does this do
Allows you to find high DPP trades that you can do, save up a bunch of ducats, then use them to buy high value items which you resell back to platinum.

**Buy item for platinum -> Sell for ducats -> Buy different item for ducats -> Sell for MORE platinum than you started with**

It assits you by:
- Scrapes sale listings placed by players on [website](https://warframe.market)https://warframe.market
- Calculates DPP (Ducats per platinum) - how many ducats can you earn from an item for each 1 platinum you spend
- Displays high DPP trades you can do (e.g. 15 dpp means for each 1 platinum you spend on buying an item from a player, you can get 15 ducats back by selling the item to the NPC)
